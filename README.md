## 📈 Problem Statement

**Why this analysis?**

Recently, AtliQ Mart has seen some key customers decide not to renew their annual contracts due to service issues. Management’s top priority is to resolve these issues by closely monitoring and improving key delivery metrics:

- **On Time (OT)** Delivery Rate
- **In Full (IF)** Delivery Rate
- **On Time In Full (OTIF)** Delivery Rate
- **Line In Full Rate (LIFR)**
- **Volume In Full Rate (VOIF)**

## ⚙️ Business Logic and KPIs

**Tracking the Right Metrics**

To address the problem, we define and measure the following performance indicators:

- **OT% (On Time)** – Percentage of orders delivered on time.
- **IF% (In Full)** – Percentage of orders delivered in full quantity.
- **OTIF% (On Time In Full)** – Percentage of orders delivered both on time and in full.
- **LIFR% (Line In Full Rate)** – Ratio of total order lines delivered in full quantity to total order quantity.
- **VOIF% (Volume In Full Rate)** – Ratio of total order volume delivered to total order quantity.

## 🔍 Key Insights

After analyzing our delivery performance, here’s what we found:

| Metric | Current Performance | Target Gap |
| ------ | ------------------- | ---------- |
| **IF%** (In Full) | ~23.73% below target | Stockouts and incomplete orders are common |
| **OT%** (On Time) | ~27.05% below target | Delivery delays impact satisfaction |
| **OTIF%** (On Time In Full) | ~36.89% below target | Struggling to deliver on both timing and order completeness |

**Key Takeaway**: Improvements in inventory planning and forecasting are essential to reach these targets and retain key customers.
